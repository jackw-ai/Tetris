# Tetris
Full featured Tetris game with music and color. Written in Python with pygame.

## Installation
This game requires Python3 and Pygame to launch. Compatability with Python2 has not been tested.

To install Pygame, type the following terminal command.
```sh
python3 -m pip install pygame --user
```
## Launch
To launch this game, simply type
```sh
Python3 Tetris.py
```
Doing so will launch a Pygame window that runs the game. 

## Start
In the startup screen displaying `Tetris (press any key to continue)`, follow the prompt and press any key to start the game.

## Controls
Control each falling piece using the `A` or `LEFT` keys to move left and `D` or `RIGHT` keys to move right. Press `S` or `DOWN` to accelerate the fall or `SPACE` to teleport the piece to the bottom. Press 'UP' or `E` to rotate the piece clockwise or `Q` to rotate counter-clockwise. After reaching `game over`, press any key to restart.

Press `P` to enter the `Pause` screen. Then, press any key to return, or hit `esc` to quit game.

## Rules
Move any of the pieces down, trying to fill a row with squares to score. Run out of space and it's `game over`. The pieces are randomly generated but the next piece will be shown on the right. The difficulty goes up as your score increases, speeding up the fall of each piece.
